        Imagine waking up not to an alarm clock, but to a gentle sunrise simulation orchestrated by your room's AI, perfectly synced with your circadian rhythm. The aroma of freshly brewed artisanal coffee wafts from the kitchenette, prepared exactly to your taste profile analyzed from your last 50 stays. This isn't science fiction—this is the standard of <strong>Orbit Hospitality</strong>.

      <h3 class="text-3xl font-serif text-white mt-12 mb-6">The Death of the "Standard Room"</h3>
      <p class="mb-6 text-lg text-gray-400 leading-relaxed">
        We believe that "standard" is an insult to the human experience. In 2026, luxury isn't about gold-plated faucets; it's about <em>frictionless existence</em>. Our properties, from <strong>Peace Lily</strong> to <strong>White Lotus</strong>, are designed as living organisms that adapt to you. The lighting shifts as you move, the acoustics dampen when you need focus, and the view... well, the view is always curated.

        "Luxury is when the space around you understands your needs before you do."

      <p class="mb-6 text-lg text-gray-400 leading-relaxed">
        Forget calling the front desk. Your Orbit suite comes equipped with a neural-linked interface (okay, maybe just a really smart app for now) that anticipates your desires. Craving a midnight feast? A private yoga session on the terrace? A helicopter tour of Bangalore? It's handled before you finish the thought.

        We've cracked the code on guilt-free indulgence. Our villas run on 100% renewable energy, our water is recycled through advanced filtration systems that make it purer than mountain springs, and our amenities are sourced from local artisans who are paid triple the market rate. You get to live like a king while saving the planet.
